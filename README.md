## Introduction
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), modelling, and deploying a machine learning model using the Penguin dataset. The goal is to predict the species of penguins based on their physical characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features of penguins such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. It is used to classify penguins into three species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap.
